# CRUD-API

We will be building `Let's Go` Simple CRUD(CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE) operations using MERN(MongoDB,Expressjs,Reactjs,Nodejs) stack

- Initialize the `npm` in the project by executing the command `npm init -y` in the terminal. It will generate the `package.json` file in our current folder

- Install the `express` by executing the command `npm i express` `Expressjs` is the `Nodejs` framework used build the APIs

- Install the `mongoose` by executing the command `npm i mongoose`
  Mongoose is a JavaScript object-oriented programing library that creates the connection between the MongoDB and Nodejs javascript runtime environment.

- In this project i am using `MongoDB Atlas` to connect to online databse we need to use connection URL. So we will be pushing this code to Gitgub we can't push all the passwords and for that we install `dotenv` package from `npmjs` like so `npm i dotenv`.And also create the `.env` file your current project folder.

- Also install `nodemon` to Refresh the server automatically when we make changes in our code instead of manually restarting the server we can do it like so `npm i nodemon`.
